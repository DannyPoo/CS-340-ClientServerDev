# CS-340-ClientServerDev

The purpose of this project is to allow users access to the animals in the Austin Animal Center (AAC) database. 
The project includes a geolocation map, pie chart, and a data table to see the animals and their information.

The application was created for our client Grazioso Salvare, to allow them to search through the database to find dogs that would be a good fit to train for search-and-rescue, such as water rescue, mountain or wilderness rescue, and disaster rescue or individual tracking. There are filters for each type to help find the dogs that would be best for each type of rescue.
